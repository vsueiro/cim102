# Lecture A – Week 13

We have discussed the scope and timeline of the third project.

The class came to an agreement that, instead of having to research and design a new product for project 3, students could improve either their first or second projects.

Students will need to conduct a more in-depth usability test and, this time, act on it.

Project 3 will culminate in a case study, comparing the before and after version of the product – as well as their reasoning behind those changes. More details will be provided on November 28.

We have also discusses the final presentation dates, as well as due dates for the remaining quizzes.

The main page of the course has been updated to reflect that.

## Reminders

We will not have classes during Thanksgiving week.
