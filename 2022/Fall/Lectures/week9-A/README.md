# Lecture A – Week 9

During this class we discussed techniques to improve our interactive prototypes.

Instead of simply relying on clicks to navigate through our screens, we experimented with *fancier* interactions, like dragging panels up and down.

Here is an example we did during class:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FXpnrehk8wC9ekQz12WEa99%2FUntitled%3Fnode-id%3D3%253A14%26starting-point-node-id%3D3%253A14" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Another common pattern is to have specific sections that scrool sideways. We went through how to build one of those:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FXpnrehk8wC9ekQz12WEa99%2FUntitled%3Fnode-id%3D3%253A71" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Regarding visual design, we also discused how to build more complex shapes – based on simpler ones. This was done using **Boolean operations**, like union or subtraction.

Here is an another example we did during class:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FXpnrehk8wC9ekQz12WEa99%2FUntitled%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
