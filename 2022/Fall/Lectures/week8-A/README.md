# Lecture B â€” Week 7

## Recap Design Project #1

Here are the details of our [first Design Project](../../Assignments/design-project-1.pdf).

We begin part III today.

## Recap Figma Advanced Features 

For creating a wireframe or a mockup, some advanced Figma features come in handy. Last class, we learned about 2 of my personal favorites:

- [Components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma)
- [Auto-layout](https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/)

For building *interactive* prototypes, however, they donâ€™t help much.

So today weâ€™ll be exploring a new feature:

- *[Interactive Components](https://www.figma.com/blog/prototyping-updates-and-interactive-components/)* âœ¨

This feature allows us to change an element on screen *without* displaying a whole frame instead. This is very useful for for pages that contain many small interactions inside of it.

Want to see it in action?

Here a simple use case for interactive components. Try popping this bubble wrap:
