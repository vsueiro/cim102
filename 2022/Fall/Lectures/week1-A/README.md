# Lecture A — Week 1

## Syllabus

The syllabus was made available via BlackBoard.

## Design

- There are [many approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design#Process) to design (and many disagreements)
- This course is focused on [user-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design)
- One of its most famous approaches is [Design Thinking](https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking), by IDEO:

![Intersection between desirabiilty, feasibility, and viability](../../../../media/desirabiilty-feasibility-viability.webp)

### How?

This process was formalized by [NNGroup](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/):

Personally, I believe the you only need to remember these 3 steps (adapted from NNGroup):

> “While design thinking is simply an approach to problem solving, it increases the probability of success and breakthrough innovation.”

- [Similar diagram](https://www.figma.com/file/vT0ZkbKerSEglVODNCdqEg/Creative-process?node-id=0%3A1
) (but actual design project)


## User Experience Design

It’s… [interdisciplinary](https://github.com/envisprecisely/disciplines-of-ux)… to say the least.

## Preparation

### Reading
- [5 Dimensions of Interaction Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/interaction-design)

![GIF](../../../../media/5-dimensions.gif)

I personnaly think _behavior_ is the most interesting.

### Figma
