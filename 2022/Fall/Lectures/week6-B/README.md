# Lecture A — Week 6

## Recap Design Project #1

Here are the details of our [first Design Project](../../Assignments/design-project-1.pdf).

## Recap on Design Thinking

NNGroup summarizes the process for creative problem solving in 3 phases:

1. Understand
2. Explore
3. Materialize

### Takeaway of Previous Exercise

Last class we did an exercise. It was focused on a myth about the “Understand” phase of the design process.

Based on a fictional scenario, students were asked to design a solution for a specific user.

This user is a customer of a hotel and asked management if they could provide “a bag”.

The exercise consisted of students trying to come with the best possible bag – but not really understading the actual need behind it.

The actual need was learning about appliances that were unfamiliar to the user (such as the garbage disposal).

As suggested by students, a possible solution would be a panflet explaining appliances – not a plastic bag for disposing food waste.

### Fictional Prompt

> People from all over the world come to the U.S. and stay in a hotel.
>
> But what if they are not familiar with some appliances?
> 
> What if they misuse them (e.g., dishwasher)?
> 
> What if they are unaware of their existance (e.g., garbage disposal)?
> 
> How might we welcome first-time visitors to the U.S. in a way they feel at home (and enjoy all these convenient appliances)?
