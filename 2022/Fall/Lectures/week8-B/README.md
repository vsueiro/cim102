# Lecture B — Week 8

In this class we have reviewed a handful of student’s projects.

The goal was to introduce students to basic visual design concepts, like keeping their styles consistent across pages.

We also went through some Figma shortcuts, like holding `Shift` while drawing shapes to make them a perfect circle, square, etc.
