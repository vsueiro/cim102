It’s… [interdisciplinary](https://github.com/envisprecisely/disciplines-of-ux)… to say the [least](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/encyclopedia/human_computer_interaction_hci/Interaction-Design-Disciplines.jpg).

## Interaction Design

- [Media Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Media_Equation)
  - “How People Treat Computers […] like Real People and Places”
  - “404” × “This is embarassing…”

  - Behavior

I personnaly think _behavior_ is the most interesting.

### Figma

Here you’ll find the assets used on the prototype:
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

## Preparation

### Pick & Present

Pick a website or app you hate using.

You don’t need to hate the _whole_ thing – just one bad interaction is enough. This could be, for example:

- A website with annoying ads or pop-ups
- An app forcing you to enter the same information twice
- A feature that does not make sense
- An interaction that does not feel intuitive
- etc…

Please bring these to class for discussion:

- 🌎 URL (example.com); or
- 📱 Screen capture or recording
