Dimension|Name|Description
---|---|---  
1D|Words|Encompass text, such as button labels, which help give users the right amount of information
2D|Visual representations|Are graphical elements such as images, typography and icons that aid in user interaction
3D|Physical objects/space|Refers to the medium through which users interact with the product or service‚Äîfor instance, a laptop via a mouse, or a mobile phone via fingers 
4D|Time|Relates to media that changes with time, such as animations, videos and sounds
5D|Behavior|Is concerned with how the previous four dimensions define the interactions a product affords‚Äîfor instance, how users can perform actions on a website, or how users can operate a car. Behavior also refers to how the product reacts to the users‚Äô inputs and provides feedback

I personnaly think _behavior_ is the most interesting.

## Preparation

### Pick & Present

Pick a website or app you hate using.

You don‚Äôt need to hate the _whole_ thing ‚Äì just one bad interaction is enough. This could be, for example:

- A website with annoying ads or pop-ups
- An app forcing you to enter the same information twice
- A feature that does not make sense
- An interaction that does not feel intuitive
- etc‚Ä¶

Please bring these to class for discussion:

- üåé URL (example.com); or
- üì± Screen capture or recording
