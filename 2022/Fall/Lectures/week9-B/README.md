# Lecture B â€“ Week 9

During this class we:

- Briefly discussed the usability testing assignment*
- Agreed on presenting Project 1 to class (next Wednesday)
- Worked on specific issues students had with their projects

Most notably, we worked on simulating a `<input type="range">` HTML element on Figma.

Even though nothing happens as we drag the handle of this slider, the dragging seems real and might be useful during a usability testing session:

## Reinders

*For the usability testing, make sure your interactive prototype works well on a mobile device ðŸ“± (via Figma app).

You will use it on your phone to test your app idea with potential users.
