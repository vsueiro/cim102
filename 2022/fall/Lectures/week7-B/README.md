Here are the details of our [first Design Project](../../Assignments/design-project-1.pdf).

Rubrics for part II were changed.

## Figma

### Components Recap

How to replicate the same type of element over and over (while keeping a single source of truth)?

This is an example we did live during class:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FV3Gx8jgup3n5IONDWeHrOU%2Fadvanced-figma-stuff%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Auto-Layout Recap

Making boxes resize and rearrange themselves according to content.

This is an example we did live during class:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FV3Gx8jgup3n5IONDWeHrOU%2Fadvanced-figma-stuff%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A118" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### In-class help

Last minutes of class will be dedicated to helping students on their own projects.
