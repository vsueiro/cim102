# Lecture A â€“ Week 10

You have build an interactive prototype, now what?

In the tech industry, instead of jumping to coding our design, there often is (or should be) an step in between: âœ¨ usability testing âœ¨.

Testing *with* users allows us (and the business) to cheaply:

- Uncover errors
- Discover opportunities

## Usability Testing Tips:

- Make it clear there are no right/wrong answers*
- Paint a scenario and describe tasks
- Donâ€™t lead answers

*Users are not the one being tested, your interface is.

This content is a simplified version of the [Usability Testing 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/) article by NNGroup.

## Reminders

*For the usability testing, make sure your interactive prototype works well on a mobile device ðŸ“± (via Figma app).
You will use it on your phone to test your app idea with potential users.

Submit what you have learned as **Assessment #2**, via Blackboard â€“ it will soon be open for submissions.

Prepare to present your Project 1 next class. It will be an informal **5-minute presentation**.

I will have your initial sketches and your final prototype ready on the projector for you to present. No need to prepare slides :)
